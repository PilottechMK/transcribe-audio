// select box table page done
// we just need to send the checked items to the backend and then the jobStatus script will run and and make the text file available for download

// for delete we need to just map through the checked items and then delete them using the delete api

// jab delete ho jayega toh fir se jobs fetch call karna padega

// jab user process pe click karega toh usko download wale table page pe le jana hai aur sath hi sath wo api bhi hit karna hai jiss se job create ho

// script to delete the jobs that are older than 5 days
